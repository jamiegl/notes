# Definitions

## Notation

If talking about functions will be talking about some

$$
f: X \longrightarrow Y
$$

from set $X$ to set $Y$.

## Image

The image of a function $f$ is the set of all possible outputs of that function, which means it is synonymous with *range* and *codomain*.
